This section provides instructions for an iOS developer to setup OneLink (deep linking and deferred deep linking) to work in the app.

There are several stages involved in the setup: 

1. [Initial app setup](dl_ios_init_setup)
2. [Unified deep linking (UDL)](dl_ios_unified_deep_linking)
3. Optionally [extended deferred deep linking](dl_ios_ocds_ddl) by using parts of the GCD API.

**Note:** Customers already using OneLink may be using the [legacy methods] (https://dev.appsflyer.com/hc/docs/ios-legacy-apis) for deep linking and deferred deep linking, instead of UDL.
