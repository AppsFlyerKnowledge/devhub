This section provides instructions for an Android developer to set up OneLink (deep linking and deferred deep linking) to work in the app.

There are several stages involved in the setup: 

1. [Initial app setup](dl_android_init_setup)
2. [Unified deep linking (UDL)](dl_android_unified_deep_linking)
3. [Optional] [Extended deferred deep linking](dl_android_ocds_ddl) using parts of the GCD API.

**Note:** Customers already using OneLink may be using the [legacy methods] (https://dev.appsflyer.com/hc/docs/android-legacy-apis) for deep linking and deferred deep linking, instead of UDL.
