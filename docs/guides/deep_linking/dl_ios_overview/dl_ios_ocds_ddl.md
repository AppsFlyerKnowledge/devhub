## Overview

Extended deferred deep linking allows deep linking for new users in certain scenarios:

- When UDL returns `NOT_FOUND` even though a relevant install occurred.
- When UDL returns `FOUND` but the deep linking data is missing parameters, which are not `deep_link_value` and `deep_link_sub1-10`.  
  Main examples for such scenarios:
  - Clicking a link in a Self Reporting Network (SRN), like Meta ads or Twitter.
  - Clicking a link that doesn't contain `deep_link_value` or `deep_link_sub1-10` used for deep-linking, for example, old links created before `deep_link_value` existed that are still in use.
  - Time between click and install exceeds the UDL lookback window (15 minutes).

To allow deferred deep linking when UDL returns `NOT_FOUND`, `onConversionDataSuccess` callback should check whether it should handle the deferred deep linking.  
`onConversionDataSuccess` is part of the Get Conversion Data(GCD) API. Its main purpose was is to [gather conversion data inside the device](../sdks/getting-started/conversion-data).  
In the use case outlined here `onConversionDataSuccess` takes advantage of the fact that all deferred deep linking parameters are passed to the callback, on top of the conversion data. 

## Prerequisites

- Implement [Unified Deep Linking](dl_ios_unified_deep_linking) to handle both deferred deep linking and direct deep linking.
- Implement `onConversionDataSuccess` to handle [deferred deep linking using GCD API](dl_ios_gcd_legacy).

## Implementation

1. `onConversionDataSuccess` should detect cases where deferred deep linking should occur that UDL didn't handle. 
   > See detailed [code dissection](#code-dissect)
2. `onConversionDataSuccess` should route the user to the deferred deep linking destination based on the deep linking parameters passed to the callback.

## Code example

### Code dissect

1. Implement the Get Conversion Data API delegate `AppsFlyerLibDelegate`. 
   >  Implement only `onConversionDataSuccess` and `onConversionDataFail`.  
   > The methods `onAppOpenAttribution` and `onAttributionFailure` are mutually exclusive with UDL, and will not be called.
2. Detect deferred deep linking scenarios by filtering-in the conversion data payload with:
   - `af_status == Non-Organic`
   - `is_first_launch == true`
3. When deferred deep linking is detected, filter-out the cases that were already handled by UDL.  
   In the example that follows, all the links contain `deep_link_value`.  
   It is recommended for UDL to signal with a flag that deferred deep linking was already handled, and `onConversionDataSuccess` should skip.
4. `onConversionDataSuccess` should verify the conversion data holds parameters that are used to route users inside the application. For example `fruit_name` in the example that follows.       
5. Route the user to the deferred deep linking destination.

### Code snippet

```swift
extension AppDelegate: AppsFlyerLibDelegate {
     
    // Handle Organic/Non-organic installation
    func onConversionDataSuccess(_ data: [AnyHashable: Any]) {
        ConversionData = data
        print("onConversionDataSuccess data:")
        for (key, value) in data {
            print(key, ":", value)
        }
        if let conversionData = data as NSDictionary? as! [String:Any]? {
        
            if let status = conversionData["af_status"] as? String {
                if (status == "Non-organic") {
                    if let sourceID = conversionData["media_source"],
                        let campaign = conversionData["campaign"] {
                        NSLog("[AFSDK] This is a Non-Organic install. Media source: \(sourceID)  Campaign: \(campaign)")
                    }
                } else {
                    NSLog("[AFSDK] This is an organic install.")
                }
                
                if let is_first_launch = conversionData["is_first_launch"] as? Bool,
                    is_first_launch {
                    NSLog("[AFSDK] First Launch")
                    if !conversionData.keys.contains("deep_link_value") && conversionData.keys.contains("fruit_name"){
                        switch conversionData["fruit_name"] {
                            case let fruitNameStr as String:
                            NSLog("This is a deferred deep link opened using conversion data")
                            walkToSceneWithParams(fruitName: fruitNameStr, deepLinkData: conversionData)
                            default:
                                NSLog("Could not extract deep_link_value or fruit_name from deep link object using conversion data")
                                return
                        }
                    }
                } else {
                    NSLog("[AFSDK] Not First Launch")
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    func onConversionDataFail(_ error: Error) {
        NSLog("[AFSDK] \(error)")
    }
}
```

## Testing

> ðŸ“˜ **Important**
> 
> The following testing scenario demonstrates the handling of deferred deep linking from links that contain custom parameters but not `deep_link_value` and `deep_link_sub1-10` parameters.  
> This testing scenario is also relevant for all extended deferred deep linking described [earlier](#overview).

### Before you begin

- Complete the implementation described earlier.
- [Register your testing device](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207031996).
- [Enable debug mode](https://dev.appsflyer.com/hc/docs/integrate-ios-sdk#enabling-debug-mode) in the app.
- Make sure the app isn't installed on your device.

### The test link

You can use an existing OneLink link or ask your marketer to create a new one for testing. Both short and long OneLink URLs can be used.

#### Adding ad-hoc parameters to the link

- Use only the domain and OneLink template of your link, for example: `https://onelink-basic-app.onelink.me/H5hv`.
- Add OneLink custom parameters other than `deep_link_value` and `deep_link_sub1-10`, as expected by your application. 
- The parameters should be added as _query parameters_.
  - Example: `https://onelink-basic-app.onelink.me/H5hv?deep_link_value=apples&deep_link_sub1=23`  

### Perform the test

- Click the link on your device.
- OneLink redirects you according to the link setup to wither the App Store or a website. 
- Install the application.
  > **Important**
  >
  > - If the application is still in development and not uploaded to the store yet, the following image displays:  
  >   <img src="https://files.readme.io/8d43627-Screenshot_20221205-191054_Chrome.jpg" alt="drawing" width="250" style="text-align: center;"/>
  > - Install the application from Xcode or any other IDE you use.
- UDL detects the deferred deep linking, matches the install to the click, and retrieves the OneLink parameters to `didResolveDeepLink` callback. **UDL will not find any parameters to route and exit**.
- `onConversionDataSuccess` callback is called with the conversion data, which holds both custom parameters and attribution data.
- `onConversionDataSuccess` sets the custom parameters to route the user inside the application.

### Expected logs results

> ðŸ“˜ The following logs are available only when [debug mode is enabled].(<https://dev.appsflyer.com/hc/docs/integrate-ios-sdk#enabling-debug-mode>)

- SDK initialized:
  ```
  [AppsFlyerSDK] [com.apple.main-thread] AppsFlyer SDK version 6.6.0 started build 
  ```

- UDL API starts:
  ```
  [AppsFlyerSDK] [com.appsflyer.serial] [DDL] Start DDL
  ```

- UDL sends query to AppsFlyer service to query a match with this install: 
  ```
  [AppsFlyerSDK] [com.appsflyer.serial] [DDL] URL: https://dlsdk.appsflyer.com/v1.0/ios/id1512793879?sdk_version=6.6&af_sig=c9a1d5b34d68e584d0db2a20f4049fb7cd2e785c3383bXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  ```

- UDL got a response and calls `didResolveDeepLink` callback with `status=FOUND` and OneLink link data:
  ```
  [AppsFlyerSDK] [com.appsflyer.serial] [DDL] Calling didResolveDeepLink with: {"af_sub4":"","click_http_referrer":"","af_sub1":"","click_event":{"af_sub4":"","click_http_referrer":"","af_sub1":"","af_sub3":"","deep_link_value":"","campaign":"","match_type":"probabilistic","af_sub5":"","campaign_id":"","media_source":"","af_sub2":""},"af_sub3":"","deep_link_value":"","campaign":"","match_type":"probabilistic","af_sub5":"","media_source":"","campaign_id":"","af_sub2":""}
  ```

- GCD is fetching the conversion data:

```
[AppsFlyerSDK] [com.appsflyer.serial] [GCD-B01] GCD 4.0 URL: https://gcdsdk.appsflyer.com/install_data/v4.0/id1512793879?devkey=s*****4&device_id=1672050642148-9221195
```



- `onConversionDataSuccess` is called with conversion data as input:

```
[AppsFlyerSDK] [com.appsflyer.serial] [GCD-A02] -[basic_app.AppDelegate onConversionDataSuccess:]:
    {
        ...
        is_first_launch=true, 
        ...
        fruit_amount=56,
        fruit_name=apples, 
        ...
        af_status=Non-organic,
        ...
    }
```
