> We recommend using our [SDK wizard integration tool](https://dj.dev.appsflyer.com/?sourceos=ios&utm_source=devhub&utm_medium=testing-ios-mnl) for testing

To successfully complete the test in this document, you must:
 * [Integrate the SDK](doc:integrate-ios-sdk)
 * [Register your testing device](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207031996).

## Test iOS SDK integration
The test consists of:
1. Simulating an ad click and installing the app:
    * If you implement ATT, follow [these instructions](#apps-that-implement-att).
    * If you don't implement ATT, follow [these instructions](#apps-that-dont-implement-att).
2. [Inspection the conversion data](#inspect-conversion-data) of the install.

### Apps that implement ATT
Follow these instructions if you implement [App Tracking Transparency](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207032066#integration-31-configuring-app-tracking-transparency-att-support) (ATT) in your app.
Attribution will occur via [ID matching](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207447053#device-id-matching) if the following conditions are met:
 * The attribution link contains the `idfa` parameter
 * ATT is implemented and:
     1. `requestTrackingAuthorization` is called before `start` (by utilizing [`waitForATTUserAuthorization`](doc:integrate-ios-sdk#enabling-app-tracking-transparency-att-support))
    2. User consent is given.

**Step 1: Simulate ad click**
Simulate an ad click via an attribution link. Structure the attribution link as follows:
```
https://app.appsflyer.com/<app_id>?pid=<media_source>
&idfa=<registered_device_idfa>
```
Where:
 * `app_id` is your AppsFlyer app ID (including `id` suffix)
 * `pid` is the media source to which the install should be attributed to
 * `idfa` is the registered device's IDFA.

**Example**
If your app ID is `id123456789`, the attribution link might look like this:
```
https://app.appsflyer.com/id123456789?pid=conversionTest1&idfa=1A2B3C4D-9128-4597-1234- 
04E23D654321
```

**Step 2: Install the app**
[Enable debug mode](doc:integrate-ios-sdk#enabling-debug-mode) and install the app on a [registered test device](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207031996-Registering-test-devices-).

**Step 3: Execute test**
Proceed to [inspect conversion data](#inspect-conversion-data).

### Apps that don't implement ATT
**Step 1: Simulate an ad click**
Simulate an ad click via an attribution link. Structure the attribution link as follows:
```
https://app.appsflyer.com/<app_id>?pid=<media_source>
```
Where:
 * `app_id` is your AppsFlyer app ID (including `id` prefix)
 * `pid` is the media source to which the install should be attributed to.

**Example**
If your app ID is `id123456789`, the attribution link might look like this:
```
https://app.appsflyer.com/id123456789?pid=conversionTest1
```
**Step 2: Install the app**
[Enable debug mode](doc:integrate-ios-sdk#enabling-debug-mode) and install the app on any deviceâ€“since the IDFA used to register the device isn't available, device registration has no effect in this case.

**Step 3: Execute test**
Proceed to [inspect conversion data](#inspect-conversion-data).

  "type": "success",
  "body": "More often than not, tests using attribution links are performed more than once. That's why it's recommended to use one of the attribution parameters to \"version\" your testsâ€“it makes it easier to understand which link triggered which conversion.\n\nIn the above example, the value of `pid` is `conversionTest1`. In consecutive tests, increment the value of `pid` to `conversionTest2`, `conversionTest3`, and so on.",

### Inspect conversion data
After simulating an ad click and installing the app, follow these steps to inspect the install's conversion data.

**Step 1: Retrieve install UID**
Once the app is installed, In the Xcode terminal, search for `conversions.appsflyer`. Look for the `uid` parameter and copy its value.

        824,
        "#4b4b50"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
**Step 2: Inspect conversion data**  
Go to [the conversion data test API](https://dev.appsflyer.com/hc/reference/gcd-get-data) and fill in the required fields:

1. `app-id`: Your app ID
2. `device_id`: paste the value of `uid` from step 1.
3. `devkey` - Application's devkey. Learn [here](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207032066-Basic-SDK-integration-guide#retrieve-the-dev-key) how to get it.


Then, click **Try it!** to execute the test.

**Expected results** 
If ATT is implemented and user consent is given, the result is a 200 response similar to (truncated for readability):
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "{\n    ...\n    \"af_status\" = \"Non-organic\";\n    ...\n    \"match_type\" = id_matching;\n    \"media_source\" = conversionTest1;\n    ...\n}",
      "language": "json",
      "name": "Terminal output"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Otherwise, attribution occurs [probabilistically](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207447053#probabilistic-modeling) and the result is a 200 response similar to (truncated for readability):
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "{\n    ...\n    \"af_status\" = \"Non-organic\";\n    ...\n    \"match_type\" = probabilistic;\n    \"media_source\" = conversionTest1;\n    ...\n}",
      "language": "json",
      "name": "Terminal output"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
If the install isn't attributed, the result is a 200 response with the following payload:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "{\n    \"af_message\" = \"organic install\";\n    \"af_status\" = Organic;\n    \"install_time\" = \"2021-08-23 06:59:51.194\";\n    \"is_first_launch\" = 1;\n}",
      "language": "json",
      "name": "Terminal output"
    }
  ]
}
