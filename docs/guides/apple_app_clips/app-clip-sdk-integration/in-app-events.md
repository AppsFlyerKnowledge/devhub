In-app events provide advertisers with the ability to record post-install events (like registrations or purchases) with customized details and attribute them to the originating media source.

In-app events for App Clips are usually derived from the in-app events set up for the full app. Therefore, if in-app events are already set up for the full app, no additional work is needed for the App Clip.
